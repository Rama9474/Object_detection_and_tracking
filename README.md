<h2>Object Detection and Tracking</h2>

This project demonstrates real-time object detection and tracking using a pre-trained SSD MobileNet v3 Large model. Built with OpenCV, it can detect and label objects in images and video feeds. The system is designed for applications in surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.

<h2>Features</h2>
- Real-time object detection in video streams.
- Bounding boxes and class labels drawn around detected objects.
- Can process both images and live camera feeds.

<h2>Installation & Usage</h2>
1. Ensure Python and OpenCV are installed.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Object_detection_tracking.py
   ```
